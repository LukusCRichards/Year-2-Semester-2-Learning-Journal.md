I had a small problem with making the minimap camera show the plane in the scene, even though I did exactly what the video showed how to do it. I thought it was because of the size of it as I haven't made a minimap camera in a while and I never experienced this issue before, but after resizing it, I realised it was the size of the camera as it showed the character I wanted moving around the scene.

I also had some confusions with writing the movement script for the character, which is mostly because I have never done it without the character controller and I never tied to do it like I did in the 2D games I made. I realised that the reason why I was struggling to write the movement for the 3D character was because I never wrote wrote the movements without using the Character Controller Component and I thought I could succeed without it.
