I had a small problem with making the minimap camera show the plane in the scene, even though I did exactly what the video showed how to do it. I thought it was because of the size of it as I haven't made a minimap camera in a while and I never experienced this issue before, but after resizing it, I realised it was the size of the camera as it showed the character I wanted moving around the scene.
